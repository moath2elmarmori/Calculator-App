# [Calculator App](https://calculator-app-moath.netlify.app)

## This project is a challenge from frontend mentor done by ME using vanilla javascript with 3 different themes for the UI, no frameworks no packages no dependecies, not anything, just a simple index.html file, style.css file and main.js file, that's it.
